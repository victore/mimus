I go play a couple keys on the piano

The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish them
Tryna find a balance reaching from my equilibrium
Fools I pity them, I'm not a human I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men
I ain't saving nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'till the angels come and skipping all the famous functions
How do the famous function?
The A list can't be trusted
I strong arm them like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society

Uh, okay
My mind is Yoda I'm on Ayatollah
These other rapper just a diet soda
I find Jehova in the darkest places
Empty as apartment basements
This a marathon gentlemen go ahead and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
Don't come up missing
Tell your bitch that you've been trippin' now you on vacation
